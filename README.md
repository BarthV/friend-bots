Friend Bots
===========

## Description ##

IRC Bot written in go to simulate the irritating presence of our friends

## Quickstart ##

Install friend-bots with the following command :

```
go get github.com/gentux/friend-bots

friend_bots
```

If it doesn't work, it's normal, I havn't tested it yet.
Don't hesitate to tell me what's wrong and I'll do whatever I can to unlock the situation

## Why GO ##

There is two main reason I started using go :

* One of our coworker, who was the inspiration for this work, talk about GO every minutes of every day
* It's a good little project to learn about the language and its ecosystem
